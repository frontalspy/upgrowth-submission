# Another Typescript React boilerplate

Another one of these things, but its a bit more strict.

Includes `React`, `Typescript`, `vite` and `Styled-Components`, and a basic `express` server.

Also comes with `jest` and `react-testing-library` for testing.

| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `npm run start` | Starts the development server |
| `npm test`  | Runs your unit tests          |
